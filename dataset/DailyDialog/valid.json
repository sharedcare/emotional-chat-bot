I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .", "trg_emotion": "neutral"}

Sometimes I think I'm addicted . __eou__ <user1> Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__ <user0> No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__ <user1> Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__ <user0> I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__ <user1> I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__ <user0> It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__ <user1> Yes . __eou__ <user0> Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__ <user1> What do you suggest ? __eou__ <user0> The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__ <user1> You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__ <user0> Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ <user1> That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ <user0> I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ <user1> I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ <user0> Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ <user1> Well . __eou__ <user0> I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ <user1> You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ <user0> No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ <user1> Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ <user0> I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ <user1> I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ <user0> Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .", "trg": "<user1> I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this \" new style . \"", "trg_emotion": "neutral"}

The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ...
